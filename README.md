# ðŸ“š C5Vision â€“ Interactiveness of the Class using IoT  

**C5Vision** is an IoT-driven classroom engagement analysis system that monitors and enhances student participation, attentiveness, and learning outcomes in real time.  
Using **Raspberry Pi 4** as the core IoT device, the system integrates **facial recognition** and **emotion detection** to evaluate student engagement during lectures, providing actionable insights for educators.  


## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **IoT Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 + Camera Module  
- **Machine Learning:** Facial Recognition & Emotion Classification Models  
- **Visualization:** Power BI  
- **Libraries Used:** OpenCV, dlib, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas


# **ðŸ“· How It Works**

1) **Capture** â€“ Raspberry Pi 4 captures live video stream of the classroom.

2) **Process** â€“ On-device Python scripts run facial recognition and emotion classification models.

3) **Analyze** â€“ Engagement metrics are derived from emotion and participation patterns.

4) **Visualize** â€“ Power BI dashboard presents actionable insights to educators.


# **ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals**

- Increase classroom interactivity and learning outcomes.

- Provide educators with real-time feedback to adapt teaching strategies.

- Bridge the gap between teaching and learning using IoT and AI.
